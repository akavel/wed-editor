
Regular Expression Syntax
-------------------------

Char		Description
----		-----------
^			Beginning of the string. The expression "^A" will match an ‘A’ only at the
			beginning of the string.

^      		The caret (^) immediately following the left-bracket ([) has a
			different meaning. It is used to exclude the remaining  characters
        	within brackets from matching the target string. The expression
			"[^0-9]" indicates that the target character should not be a digit.

[]     		Brackets ([ and ]) enclosing a set of characters indicates that any of
			the enclosed characters may match the target  character.

$       	The dollar sign ($) will match the end of the string. The expression
			"abc$" will match the sub-string "abc" only if it is at the end of the string.
|       	The alternation character (|) allows either expression on its side to
			match the target string. The expression "a|b" will match  ‘a’ as well as ‘b’.

.       	The dot (.) will match any character.

*		 	The asterix (*) indicates that the character to the left of the asterix
			in the expression should match 0 or more times.

+			The plus (+) is similar to asterix but there should be at least one
			match of the character to the left of the + sign in the
        	expression.

?       	The question mark (?) matches the character to its left 0 or 1 times.

()			The parenthesis affects the order of pattern evaluation and also
			serves as a tagged expression that can be used when replacing the
			matched sub-string with another expression.
